## Our Mission

The Existential Heroism Institute provides strategic analysis for world-scale issues along with research, reports, projects, and educational materials to support social and environmental solutions. Knowing the difficulty of this task, we look to provide both the psychological grounding and cognitive toolkits necessary for the individual to develop into an Existential Hero.
