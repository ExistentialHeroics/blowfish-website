Central themes in the book include the uniqueness of man, the role of heroism in society, and the nature of fear.\nEscape from Evil by Ernest Becker # Synopsis: Ernest Becker’s Escape from Evil (1975) builds upon the themes explored in his previous work, The Denial of Death, to delve into the dark aspects of human nature and culture. In this book, Becker explores how the fear of death drives individuals and societies to commit acts of evil and violence in an attempt to achieve a sense of transcendence and immortality. Central themes in the book include further insights derived from The Denial of Death, the nature of evil, and the nature of human aggression.\nMore Readings # Capital in the 21st century – Thomas Piketty Critical Path – Buckminster Fuller Finite and Infinite Games – James P.
