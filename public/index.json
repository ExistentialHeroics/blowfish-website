His ideas stimulated new lines of investigation not only in psychology but also in social science, religion, history, and anthropology. A pupil, colleague, and early follower of Freud (and later one of his chief dissenters), Rank settled in America in 1933 for a \u0026ldquo;sabbatical leave\u0026rdquo; devoted to therapy and teaching. Beyond Psychology was his first book in English, and it contains the results of a lifetime of thought and research about man\u0026rsquo;s essential nature.\nIn Beyond Psychology Rank explores the ultimates of human existence — the fear of death, the desire for immortality, the nature of sexuality, the basis of personality, the nature of social organization, the need for love, the meaning of creativity. He notes the failure of rational ideologies to cope with the instability in our social order, the lack of generally accepted ideals, the hostility, fear, and guilt that seem to characterize our civilization. Rank seeks to understand the basic human problems not by a rejection of irrationality but by an acceptance of it as an inevitable fact of human existence.\nAfter a detailed critique of rational psychologies, he examines the myth of The Double in legend and literature in order to investigate the development of the ideal of the Soul, and he traces the reflection of man\u0026rsquo;s fear of final destruction in social organizations, ideologies, concepts of personality, sexual roles, and religion. Among the subjects investigated in this searching analysis are kingship and magic participation, the institution of marriage, power and the state, Messianism, the doctrine of rebirth, the two kinds of love (Agape and Eros), the creation of the sexual self, feminine psychology and masculine ideology, and psychology beyond the self.\nLink # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/resources/reading-list/books/beyond-psychology/","section":"Resources","summary":"Description # Psychologist, psychoanalyst, sociologist, teacher, Otto Rank (1884–1939) wrote on such subjects as the artist, myth, the hero, sexuality, guilt, dreams, neurosis, and the technique and history of psychoanalysis.","title":"Beyond Psychology by Otto Rank","type":"resources"},{"content":" A comprehensive reading list to start your existential hero\u0026rsquo;s journey. # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/resources/reading-list/","section":"Resources","summary":"A comprehensive reading list to start your existential hero\u0026rsquo;s journey.","title":"Books","type":"resources"},{"content":" Description # What are the grand dynamics that drive the accumulation and distribution of capital? Questions about the long-term evolution of inequality, the concentration of wealth, and the prospects for economic growth lie at the heart of political economy. But satisfactory answers have been hard to find for lack of adequate data and clear guiding theories. In Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Thomas Piketty analyzes a unique collection of data from 20 countries, ranging as far back as the 18th century, to uncover key economic and social patterns. His findings will transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and inequality.\nPiketty shows that modern economic growth and the diffusion of knowledge have allowed us to avoid inequalities on the apocalyptic scale predicted by Karl Marx. But we have not modified the deep structures of capital and inequality as much as we thought in the optimistic decades following World War II. The main driver of inequality - the tendency of returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growth - today threatens to generate extreme inequalities that stir discontent and undermine democratic values. But economic trends are not acts of God. Political action has curbed dangerous inequalities in the past, Piketty says, and may do so again.\nA work of extraordinary ambition, originality, and rigor, Capital in the Twenty-First Century reorients our understanding of economic history and confronts us with sobering lessons for today.\nLink # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/resources/reading-list/books/capital-in-the-21st-century/","section":"Resources","summary":"Description # What are the grand dynamics that drive the accumulation and distribution of capital?","title":"Capital in the 21st Century by Thomas Piketty","type":"resources"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":" Description # R.

Carse as he begins this extraordinary book. “One could be called finite; the other infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.”\nFinite games are the familiar contests of everyday life; they are played in order to be won, which is when they end. But infinite games are more mysterious. Their object is not winning, but ensuring the continuation of play. The rules may change, the boundaries may change, even the participants may change—as long as the game is never allowed to come to an end.\nWhat are infinite games? How do they affect the ways we play our finite games? What are we doing when we play—finitely or infinitely? And how can infinite games affect the ways in which we live our lives?\nCarse explores these questions with stunning elegance, teasing out of his distinctions a universe of observation and insight, noting where and why and how we play, finitely and infinitely. He surveys our world—from the finite games of the playing field and playing board to the infinite games found in culture and religion—leaving all we think we know illuminated and transformed. Along the way, Carse finds new ways of understanding everything, from how an actress portrays a role to how we engage in sex, from the nature of evil to the nature of science. Finite games, he shows, may offer wealth and status, power and glory, but infinite games offer something far more subtle and far grander.\nCarse has written a book rich in insight and aphorism. Already an international literary event, Finite and Infinite Games is certain to be argued about and celebrated for years to come. Reading it is the first step in learning to play the infinite game.\nLink # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/resources/reading-list/books/finite-and-infinite-games/","section":"Resources","summary":"Description # “There are at least two kinds of games,” states James P.","title":"Finite and Infinite Games by James P.

In its scope and interest it can be compared with Freud\u0026rsquo;s Totem and Taboo, the subtext Girard refutes with polemic daring, vast erudition, and a persuasiveness that leaves the reader compelled to respond, one way or another.\nThis is the single fullest summation of Girard\u0026rsquo;s ideas to date, the book by which they will stand or fall. In a dialogue with two psychiatrists (Jean-Michel Oughourlian and Guy Lefort), Girard probes an encyclopedic array of topics, ranging across the entire spectrum of anthropology, psychoanalysis, and cultural production.\nGirard\u0026rsquo;s point of departure is what he calls \u0026ldquo;mimesis,\u0026rdquo; the conflict that arises when human rivals compete to differentiate themselves from each other, yet succeed only in becoming more and more alike. At certain points in the life of a society, according to Girard, this mimetic conflict erupts into a crisis in which all difference dissolves in indiscriminate violence. In primitive societies, such crises were resolved by the \u0026ldquo;scapegoating mechanism,\u0026rdquo; in which the community, en masse, turned on an unpremeditated victim. The repression of this collective murder and its repetition in ritual sacrifice then formed the foundations of both religion and the restored social order.\nHow does Christianity, at once the most \u0026ldquo;sacrificial\u0026rdquo; of religions and a faith with a non-violent ideology, fit into this scheme? Girard grants Freud\u0026rsquo;s point, in Totem and Taboo, that Christianity is similar to primitive religion, but only to refute Freud―if Christ is sacrificed, Girard argues, it is not because God willed it, but because human beings wanted it.\nThe book is not merely, or perhaps not mainly, biblical exegesis, for within its scope fall some of the most vexing problems of social history―the paradox that violence has social efficacy, the function of the scapegoat, the mechanism of anti-semitism.\nLink # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/resources/reading-list/books/things-hidden/","section":"Resources","summary":"Description # An astonishing work of cultural criticism, this book is widely recognized as a brilliant and devastating challenge to conventional views of literature, anthropology, religion, and psychoanalysis.","title":"Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World by Rene Girard","type":"resources"},{"content":" For commonly asked questions about Worldcoin please visit worldcoin.org/faqs\nA New Identity and Financial Network # Disclaimer\nThis crypto-asset white paper has not been approved by any competent authority in any Member State of the European Union. The person seeking admission to trading is solely responsible for the content of this crypto-asset white paper.\nThis cryptoasset white paper complies with Title II of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 and, to the best of the knowledge of the management body, the information presented in the crypto-asset white paper is fair, clear and not misleading and the crypto-asset white paper makes no omission likely to affect its import.\nIntroducing Worldcoin # Worldcoin was founded with the mission of creating a globally-inclusive identity and financial network, owned by the majority of humanity. If successful, Worldcoin could considerably increase economic opportunity, scale a reliable solution for distinguishing humans from AI online while preserving privacy, enable global democratic processes, and show a potential path to AI-funded UBI.\nWorldcoin consists of a privacy-preserving digital identity network (World ID) built on proof of personhood and, where laws allow, a digital currency (WLD). Every human is eligible for a share of WLD simply for being human. World ID and WLD are currently complemented by World App, the first frontend to World ID and the Worldcoin Protocol, developed by the contributor team at Tools for Humanity (TFH).\n“Proof of personhood” is one of the core ideas behind Worldcoin, and refers to establishing an individual is both human and unique. Once established, it gives the individual the ability to assert they are a real person and different from another real person, without having to reveal their real-world identity.\nToday, proof of personhood is an unsolved problem on a global scale, making it difficult to vote online or distribute value on a large scale. The problem is even more pressing as increasingly powerful AI models will further amplify the difficulty of distinguishing humans from bots. If successful as part of Worldcoin, World ID could become a global proof of personhood standard.\nSome of the core assumptions behind Worldcoin are:\nProof of personhood is a missing and necessary digital primitive. This primitive will become more important as increasingly powerful AI models become available. Scalable and inclusive proof of personhood, for the first time, allows aligning the incentives of all network participants around adding real humans to the network. Bitcoin is issued to secure the Bitcoin network. Worldcoin is issued to grow the Worldcoin network, with security inherited from Ethereum. In a time of increasingly powerful AI, the most reliable way to issue a global proof of personhood is through custom biometric hardware. The following dynamic Whitepaper shares the reasoning behind the implementation of the project as well as the current state and roadmap. World ID # World ID is privacy preserving proof of personhood. It enables users to verify their humanness online while maintaining their privacy through zero-knowledge proofs, via a custom biometric device called the Orb. The Orb has been designed based on the realization that custom biometric hardware might be the only long term viable solution to issue AI-safe proof of personhood verifications. World IDs are issued on the Worldcoin protocol, which allows individuals to prove that they are human to any verifier (including web2 applications) while maintaining their privacy through zero-knowledge proofs. In the future, it should be possible to issue other credentials on the protocol as well.\nWorld ID aspires to be personbound, meaning a World ID should only be used by the individual it was issued to. It should be very difficult to use by a fraudulent actor who stole or acquired World ID credentials.\nWorldcoin Token # While network effects will ultimately come from useful applications being built on top of the financial and identity infrastructure, the token is issued to all network participants to align their incentives around the growth of the network. This is especially important early on to bootstrap the network and bypass the “cold start problem”.\nWorld App # World App is the first frontend to World ID: it guides individuals through the verification with the Orb, custodies an individual’s World ID credentials and implements the cryptographic protocols to share those credentials with third parties in a privacy preserving manner. It is designed to provide frictionless access to global decentralized financial infrastructure. Eventually, there should be many different wallets integrating World ID.\nHow does Worldcoin Work? # Worldcoin revolves around World ID, a privacy-preserving global identity network. Using World ID, individuals will be able to prove that they are a real, unique human to any platform that integrates with the protocol. This will enable fair airdrops, provide protection against bots/sybil attacks on social media, and enable the fairer distribution of limited resources. Furthermore, World ID can also enable global democratic processes and novel forms of governance (e.g., via quadratic voting), and it may eventually support a path to AI-funded UBI.\nTo engage with the Worldcoin protocol, individuals must first download World App, the first wallet app that supports the creation of a World ID. Individuals visit a physical imaging device called the Orb to get their World ID Orb-verified. Most Orbs are operated by a network of independent local businesses called Orb Operators. The Orb uses multispectral sensors to verify humanness and uniqueness to issue an Orb-verified World ID.\nPotential Applications # Worldcoin could significantly increase equality of opportunity globally by advancing a future where everyone, regardless of their location, can participate in the global digital economy through universally-accessible decentralized financial and identity infrastructure. As the network grows, so should its utility.\nToday, many interactions in the digital realm are not possible globally. The way humans transact value, identify themselves, and interact on the internet is likely to change fundamentally. With universal access to finance and identity, the following future becomes possible:\nFinance # Owning \u0026amp; Transferring Digital Money: Sending money will be near instant and borderless, globally. Available to everyone. The world could be connected financially and everyone would be able to interact economically on the internet. The COVID relief fund for India, where over $400 million was raised in a short period of time by individuals around the world to support the country is a hint at what can be possible. Overall, this has the potential to connect people on a global scale unlike anything previously seen in human history.\nDigital money is safer than cash, which can be more easily stolen or forged. This is especially important in crisis situations where instant cross-border financial transactions need to be possible, such as during the Ukrainian refugee crisis, where USDC was used to distribute direct aid. Additionally, digital money is an asset that individuals can own and control directly without having to trust third parties.\nIdentity # Keep the Bots Out: Bots on Twitter, spam messages, and robocalls are all symptoms of the lack of sound and frictionless digital identity. These issues are exacerbated by rapidly advancing AI models, which can solve CAPTCHAs and produce content that is convincingly \u0026ldquo;human\u0026rdquo;. As services ramp up defenses against such content, it becomes essential that an inclusive and privacy-preserving solution for proof of personhood is available as public infrastructure. If every message or transaction included a \u0026ldquo;verified human\u0026rdquo; property, a lot of noise could be filtered from the digital world.\nGovernance: Currently, collective decision making in web3 largely relies on token-based governance (one token, one vote), which excludes some people from participating and heavily favors those with more economic power. A reliable sybil-resistant proof of personhood like World ID opens up the design space for global democratic governance mechanisms not just in web3 but for the internet. Additionally, for AI to maximally benefit all humans, rather than just a select group, it will become increasingly important to include everyone in its governance.\nIntersection of Finance and Identity # Incentive Alignment: Coupons, loyalty programs, referral programs and more generally sharing value with customers are traditionally prone to fraud as the incentives for fraudulent actors are high. Frictionless and fraud resistant digital identity helps to align incentives and benefit both consumers and companies. This could even incept a new wave of companies owned in part by their users.\nEqual Distribution of Scarce Resources: Crucial elements of modern society, including subsidies and social welfare, can be rendered more equitably by employing proof of personhood. This is particularly pertinent in developing economies, where social benefit programs confront the issue of resource capture—fake identities employed to acquire more than a person’s fair share of resources. In 2021, India saved over $500 million in subsidy programs by implementing a biometric-based system that reduced fraud. A decentralized proof of personhood protocol can extend similar benefits to any project or organization globally. As AI advances, fairly distributing access and some of the created value through UBI will play an increasingly vital role in counteracting the concentration of economic power. World ID could ensure that each individual registers only once and to guarantee equitable distribution.\nProof of Personhood (PoP) # Different applications have different requirements for PoP. For high-stakes use cases such as global UBI, the democratic governance of AI and the Worldcoin project, a highly secure and inclusive PoP mechanism to prevent multiple registrations is needed. Therefore, the Worldcoin developer community with the Worldcoin Foundation is laying the foundations for a high-assurance PoP mechanism with World ID. A World ID is issued upon World App installation and is fully verified when the holder visits an Orb and conducts the biometric verification. The following sections walk through the fundamental building blocks of PoP and how those are implemented in the context of World ID.\nBuilding Blocks # On a high level, there are several building blocks that are required for an effective PoP mechanism. These include “deduplication” to ensure everyone can only verify once, “authentication” to ensure only the legitimate owner of the proof of personhood credential can use it and “recovery” in case of lost or compromised credentials. This section discusses these building blocks on a high level.\nA proof of personhood mechanism consists of three different actors and the data that they exchange.\nFig. 1 - Highly simplified diagram describing the interaction of the different actors of a proof of personhood ecosystem that are required for a user to authenticate as human. User: An individual seeking to prove specific claims about herself in order to access certain resources or more generally qualify for certain actions. Within the context of a PoP protocol those claims are related to proving uniqueness and personhood.\nCredential: A collection of data that serves as proof for particular attributes of the user that indicate the user is a human being. This could be a range of things, from the possession of a valid government ID to being verified as human and unique through biometrics.\nIssuer: An trusted entity that affirms certain information about the user and grants them a PoP credential, which enables the user to prove their claims to others.\nVerifier: An entity that examines a user\u0026rsquo;s PoP credential and checks its authenticity as part of a verification process to grant the user access to certain actions.\nCertain interactions between users, issuers and verifiers, like deduplication, recovery and authentication are important building blocks for a functional PoP mechanism. This section gives a high level overview of the building blocks of a general PoP mechanism. Detailed explanations on how those are implemented with World ID follow in later sections.\nBesu Configuration # Genesis File # We define QBFT consensus in the node\u0026rsquo;s genesis file:\n{ \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;chainid\u0026#34;: 1337, \u0026#34;berlinBlock\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;qbft\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;epochlength\u0026#34;: 30000, \u0026#34;blockperiodseconds\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;requesttimeoutseconds\u0026#34;: 10 } }, \u0026#34;nonce\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0x0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0x5b3d92d7\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;gasLimit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0x29b92700\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;difficulty\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0x1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;coinbase\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;alloc\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;64d9be4177f418bcf4e56adad85f33e3a64efe22\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;balance\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0x446c3b15f9926687d2c40534fdb564000000000000\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;9f66f8a0f0a6537e4a36aa1799673ea7ae97a166\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;balance\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0x446c3b15f9926687d2c40534fdb564000000000000\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;a7f25969fb6f3d5ac09a88862c90b5ff664557a7\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;balance\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0x446c3b15f9926687d2c40534fdb564000000000000\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;f4bbfd32c11c9d63e9b4c77bb225810f840342df\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;balance\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0x446c3b15f9926687d2c40534fdb564000000000000\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;number\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0x0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;gasUsed\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0x0\u0026#34; } Node Hierarchy # flowchart TB Admin \u003c--\u003e Basic1 \u0026 Basic2 ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/whitepaper/","section":"Existential Heroism Institute","summary":"For commonly asked questions about Worldcoin please visit worldcoin.","title":"Whitepaper","type":"page"}]
